      <h2 id="about">About OFraMP</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        OFraMP is an Online tool for Fragment-based Molecule Parameterisation.
        The 'Online' part we all get, but what about the fragment-based molecule
        parameterisation? Well, it is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Every molecule has a charge, consisting of the sum of the charges of all
        atoms inside that molecule. Finding the total charge of a molecule is
        relatively easy, but finding the charges for the individual atoms is a
        hard and mathematically complex problem. It is theorised though, that common
        fragments of similar molecules should have roughly the same charges, allowing
        for a new way of parameterising a molecule: based on fragments.
      </p>
      <p>
        OFraMP is the first tool to implement this concept. Combined with its
        supporting systems OAPoC (Online tool for Atom Position Calculation) and
        OMFraF (Online tool for Molecule Fragment Finding), OFraMP allows the user
        to insert a molecule and then present him with matching fragments of similar
        molecules, such that he can select the best matches and completely
        parameterise the molecule he inserted.
      </p>
      <p>
        OFraMP has originally been created as a graduation project for the Master
        Software Engineering at the University of Amsterdam, carried out at Centrum
        Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI). The project was aimed at interaction
        design, and not too focused on chemical correctness. Nevertheless, it is
        believed that the foundation has been laid for a system that is of great
        value in chemistry research.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope you have a good time using the system and that it can help you to
        parameterise a lot of molecules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kind regards,<br />
        Jimi van der Woning, creator of OFraMP
      </p>

      <h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started with OFraMP</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Upon loading OFraMP for the first time, you should see something like the following screen:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/gs_1.png" alt="OFraMP welcome screen" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on whether you want to take a short tour or just use the system,
        you should now click either the 'Start demo' or the 'New molecule'
        button respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, the welcome screen might also look like either one of the following:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/gs_2.png" alt="OFraMP welcome screen (warning)" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/gs_3.png" alt="OFraMP welcome screen (error)" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In cases where the site matches the first of these screenshots (with yellow
        background), there is not necessarily a problem. It does mean, however,
        that the system will be functioning less smooth and, depending on your
        browser, some functionality may not be available.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you see a screen matching the second screenshot (red background),
        you need to use a different browser if you want to use OFraMP. In this
        case, you are using a browser of over five years old, which cannot
        possibly be supported.
      </p>
      <p>
        In either of these two cases, it is advisable to upgrade your browser
        to the latest version of Google Chrome, which can be downloaded
        <a href="http://chrome.google.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. OFraMP has
        been implemented on and optimised for Chrome, as this is currently the
        best performing browser for canvas drawing (which is used to display the
        molecules).
      </p>
      <h3 id="submitting">Entering a molecule into OFraMP</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The window for entering a molecule into OFraMP should look like the following:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/em_1.png" alt="Enter molecule" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, you can enter a molecule into the system using the PDB, SMILES or
        InChI format. Support for other formats may be added later, but is
        currently limited to these formats as they are the most used ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you want to use a molecule that is present in the
        <a href="http://compbio.biosci.uq.edu.au/atb/index.py?tab=home_tab">Automated Topology Builder (ATB)</a>,
        it is also possible to enter this molecule's Molecule ID
        directly into OFraMP. This will automatically retrieve the molecule's
        PDB file from the ATB, such that you do not need to do this yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this window, it is also possible to <a href="#repository">change the repository</a>
        that will be used for finding molecule fragments and to
        <a href="#shell">modify the shell size</a> of the fragments that need
        to match. More information on these subjects can be found in the
        <a href="#advanced">Advanced features</a> section below.
      </p>
      <h3 id="viewing">Viewing the molecule</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In case you enter the SMILES string <kbd>NCC(=O)CCO</kbd> into the system,
        you should initially see something like the following:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/vm_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        As the 'Loading fragments...' text indicates, the fragments matching this
        molecule are now being loaded, so fragment finding is not yet possible at
        this stage. What you <em>can</em> already do is view the molecule. You can
        drag it around by holding down your <em>left</em> mouse button and dragging
        your mouse. You can also zoom in or out using your mouse's scrollwheel.
      </p>
      <h3 id="starting">Starting the parameterisation process</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As soon as the fragments have been loaded, starting the parameterisation
        process is easy. You just click the 'Start parameterising' button at
        the bottom of the page:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/sp_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <h3 id="parameterising">Parameterising the molecule</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Once the 'Start parameterising' button has been clicked, a matching molecule
        fragment will automatically loaded and previewed in the molecule (indicated
        in green, with the thicker border). Three buttons will appear: 'View original',
        'Accept' and 'Reject': <br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/pm_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking the 'View original' button will show the molecule from which
        the fragment originates:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/pm_2.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The image above shows the original molecule for the selected fragment
        in the previous image. The green atoms here indicate the atoms that are
        part of the fragment, which corresponds to the atoms that are marked in
        green in the molecule. The atom(s) that are marked in a darker green without
        the thick border
        are the atoms that are part of the shell. In this case, that shell consists
        of just the C atom of the only CH group in the molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <strong>Tip:</strong><br />
          The 'Fragment molecule' popup can be dragged around by holding the <em>left</em>
          mouse button on the title bar (that contains the 'Fragment molecule...' text)
          and dragging the mouse. This way, you can easily compare the fragment molecule
          with the other molecule by dragging them such that both are visible.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        After checking the fragment molecule, you need to accept or reject the
        proposed fragment. Upon accepting the fragment, the charges of the fragment
        atoms will be copied to the corresponding atoms in the molecule. New
        fragments will be found for an unparameterised atom that still remains
        in the molecule, and you can repeat the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not think a proposed fragment is a proper match with the molecule,
        you can reject it using the 'Reject' button. The next best match will
        be shown, which, again, you can view the originating molecule of, and accept
        or reject it. At some point, you may have seen all possible matching
        fragments. In that case, the 'Reject' button will be disabled and you
        will need to either accept the last fragment or go back to a previous one.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have accidentally rejected or accepted a fragment, you can undo this using the
        'Undo' button at the top of the page (or using the <kbd>Alt+Z</kbd>
        keyboard shortcut). This will restore the previous state of the molecule,
        such that you can fix the mistake you made.
      </p>
      <p>
        A final important thing to note here is that, in some cases,
        no fragments may have been found for some atoms. This will be indicated by marking them
        with a red/pink background, as can be seen in the rightmost CH<sub>2</sub>
        group of the molecule in the first image of this section. You can still
        assign charges to these atoms <a href="#editing">manually</a>, which is discussed below.
      </p>
      <h3 id="completing">Completing the charges of a molecule</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Upon continuing to parameterise a molecule, it is possible that you run
        into fragments that contain atoms to which a charge has already been
        assigned. The atoms in question are given a yellow background:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/cc_5.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The charge that is shown here is the average of the charge the atom currently
        has and the charge it has in the proposed fragment. Upon accepting the
        fragment, this average charge will be assigned to the atom.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a charge has been assigned to all <em>parameterisable</em> atoms,
        one of the following two popups will be shown:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/cc_3.png" alt="" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/cc_4.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If the title of the popup says 'Fully parameterised', <em>all</em> a charge
        has been assigned to all atoms of the molecule. Generally, you are done
        now and you can download an LGF file containing the results. If you wish
        to manually adjust some charges, you can do so by closing the popup and
        selecting the atoms that you want to adjust the charges of. More information
        on this can be found <a href="#editing">below</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, when the popup says 'No more options available', there are
        still some atoms remaining for which no fragments are available. You can
        download the LGF file, but the charges for those atoms will be set to 0.
        It might be better to manually assign charges to the atoms, which can be
        done by closing the popup and selecting the atoms you wish to parameterise.
        More information on this can be found <a href="#editing">below</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you feel like you are completely done (or at any point in the meantime),
        you can download an LGF file containing the results by clicking the
        'Download' button in the menu bar.
      </p>

      <h2 id="advanced">OFraMP's advanced features</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Besides just the basic functionality, OFraMP also has some features for
        the more advanced users. These features will be discussed in this section.
      </p>
      <h3 id="repository">Using a different repository</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        For finding the fragments of other molecules, OFraMP uses a repository
        of molecules that will be compared to the molecule you enter into the
        system. What fragments will be found, depends on what repository you select.
        It may be interesting to experiment with selecting different repositories,
        to see what repository results in the best parameterisation of the molecule.
        This can be done at the time you enter your molecule into the system, by
        changing the selection of the 'Fragment repository':<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/cr_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <h3 id="shell">Using a different shell size</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        When finding matching fragments, the atoms around the fragment need to
        match the original molecule as well. The shell size indicates the distance
        from the fragment to which all atoms should match the original molecule.
        By increasing the shell size, fragments will probably match the original
        molecule better, but less fragments may be found. Decreasing the shell
        size will have the opposite effect. The shell size can be modified at the
        time when you enter a molecule into the system, by selecting a different
        value for the 'Shell size':<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/cs_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <h3 id="selecting">Checking atom details</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        If you want to see more detailed information about one or multiple atoms, you need
        to select the atom(s) you want to see de details of. There are
        multiple ways of doing this. The first and easiest of these is to make
        a single-atom selection, which can be done by simply clicking on that atom:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/sa_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to select multiple atoms at once, one can best hold the <em>right</em>
        mouse button and drag to draw a selection rectangle in which all atoms
        will be selected (see left image below). Alternatively, one could also
        hold down the Ctrl key while clicking atoms, to add these to the selection.
        Finally, if both the Ctrl key and right mouse button are unavailable
        on your device, multi-atom selections can be made by activating the
        'Selection modification mode'. This can be done by clicking the
        'Modify selection' button in the 'Selection details' window (see right
        image below). Now, every atom you click will be added to the selection.
        This mode can be exited again by clicking the 'Stop modifying selection'
        button that will appear in the 'Selection details' window.
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/sa_2.png" alt="" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/sa_4.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        What is probably the most important feature of the atom details window is
        that it provides a way to manually enter or alter atom charges. How this
        works is discussed in the next section.
      </p>
      <h3 id="editing">Manually adding / editing atom charges</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        If you wish to manually add or edit an atom's charge, you first need to
        select that atom. In the 'Selection details' window, there will be a row
        in the table that says 'Selected atoms', with a 'Show' button next to it
        (where it says 'Hide' in the screenshot below). Clicking that button will
        expand another table containing detailed information about all atoms that
        are part of the current selection:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/ec_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <strong>Tip:</strong><br />
          Hovering your mouse over the 'Selected atoms' table rows will highlight
          the atom which' row your mouse cursor is currently over. This way you
          can easily determine which row corresponds to which atom.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'Elem' column contains the element of the atom and its IACM number
        (between parentheses). The 'Charge' column contains the atom's charge or,
        when the 'Edit' button is clicked, a text input field using which you
        can change the charge. After you have changed a charge, make sure to click
        the 'Apply' button in the 'Edit' column, to make sure the charges are
        also assigned properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the 'Show' button in the 'Frags' column will show the fragment(s)
        that have been used to get to the charge the atom currently has:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/ec_2.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        The molecules from which these fragments came can be displayed once again
        by clicking the 'Show molecule' button in that fragment (see the
        <a href="#finding">Finding fragments</a> section above). These fragments
        may be useful to determine the charge of the atom.
      </p>
      <h3 id="saving">Making and loading checkpoints</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As parameterising molecules may take some time, OFraMP has the ability
        to store the current state and load this at at a later stage. In order to
        make such checkpoint, you should click the 'Checkpoint' button in the
        menu at the top of the page. An OFraMP Structure Storage (.oss) file
        should automatically be downloaded to your computer:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/mc_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to load a checkpoint at a later stage, you should use the
        'Load from OSS file' button in the 'Insert molecule' popup. This will
        open a file prompt that lets you select the OSS file, after which it
        will be loaded:
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/mc_2.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <h3 id="settings">Changing visualisation settings</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Many parameters of the molecule visualisation part of OFraMP can be
        modified in the settings menu. To get there, you first need to open up
        the 'advanced controls' menu by clicking the rigtmost menu button (looks
        like some sort of downwards arrow, see left image). In that menu, you
        find a 'Settings' button that will open up the 'OFraMP settings' menu
        at the right side of the screen.<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/es_1.png" alt="" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/es_2.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        In the settings menu, many things can be changed. The image below shows
        the effect of turning on the <kbd>atom.showHAtoms</kbd> parameter:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/es_3.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are done changing the settings, you can close the menu by either
        clicking on the 'Settings' button in the 'advanced controls' menu again,
        or clicking on the 'OFraMP settings' title bar.
      </p>
      <h3 id="shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        For your convenience, OFraMP has some keyboard shortcuts. Below, you can
        find a list of them:
      </p>
      <table id="kbd_shortcuts">
        <tr>
          <th>Key combination</th>
          <th>Action</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+Z</td>
          <td>Undo last action</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+Shift+Z</td>
          <td>Redo last action</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+Y</td>
          <td>Redo last action</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+N</td>
          <td>Open 'Insert molecule' popup (New)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+O</td>
          <td>Load a checkpoint from an OSS file (Open)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+S</td>
          <td>Create an OSS checkpoint (Save)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+L</td>
          <td>Download molecule as LGF</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Alt+H</td>
          <td>Open Help</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Note that these shortcuts all use the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key rather that the
        <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key that is generally used for keyboard shortcuts. Unfortunately,
        most browsers use combinations with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> as their own shortcuts
        and do not allow you to override them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="errors">Solving OFraMP problems</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Even though a lot of time has been invested into making OFraMP fault-proof,
        some problems might still occur. The most common problems are discussed
        below.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you encounter any problems that are not listed here, please
        report them as detailed as possible to the
        <a href="https://github.com/jimivdw/OFraMP/issues/new">OFraMP issue tracker</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="oapocerror">Online Atom Position Calculator (OAPoC) errors</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        OAPoC is the system that is used to get the positions of a molecule's atoms, in order
        to be able to visualise the molecule. There are three problems you may encounter:
        connection errors, version errors and generic errors. The connection and
        version errors will look like the following images:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/oa_1.png" alt="" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/oa_2.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get a connection error, the best you can do is checking your
        internet connection and trying again. If this does not work, the OAPoC
        server is probably down for maintenance and should be up shortly afterwards.
        The best you can do then is wait for a while and then trying again to see
        if the server is back up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version errors should generally not occur at all. The only time you may
        see such error is just around a system update, when only half of the
        system has been updated. Again, these errors can only be resolved by
        waiting for a bit and trying again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generic errors all have to do with the molecule data you enter into the
        system, and may look like the following:
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/oa_3.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If you get an error like this, you have probably inserted some wrong
        data into the system. Please make sure the data is either in PDB, SMILES
        or InChI format, or is an ATB Molecule ID, and then try again.
      </p>
      <h3 id="omfraferror">Online Molecule Fragment Finder (OMFraF) errors</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        OMFraF is the system responsible for generating and finding fragments
        that resemble the molecule you enter. Without it, OFraMP can still be
        used to display a molecule, but fragment finding will not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        When OMFraF cannot be reached upon loading OFraMP, the following error
        message will be shown:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/om_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        You can ignore this, and still enter a molecule into the system, but,
        as mentioned before, fragment finding will not be possible. The best way
        to resolve this is to just wait until OMFraF comes back up again, which
        it should do shortly.
      </p>
      <p>
        OMFraF can also produce errors upon generating fragments (left image)
        or finding fragments that match the selection (right image):<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/om_2.png" alt="" />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/om_3.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these errors should generally be resolved automatically by just
        waiting a few minutes and then trying again. Unfortunately, there is not
        much else you can do, as both of these errors are due to connection
        problems.
      </p>
      <h3 id="miscerror">Miscellaneous errors</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        One final common error is that the following screen is the only thing
        that shows, and nothing happens afterwards:<br />
        <img class="thumb" src="static/img/help/me_1.png" alt="" />
      </p>
      <p>
        If this happens, you probably have disabled JavaScript in your browser.
        OFraMP is a modern tool that uses the latest web technologies and relies
        on JavaScript being activated. Please either turn on JavaScript in your
        browser for all pages (which is recommended), or add an exception
        for OFraMP. Without JavaScript, the system cannot function, unfortunately.
